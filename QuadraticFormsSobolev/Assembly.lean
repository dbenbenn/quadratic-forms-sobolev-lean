Assembling Step 2 of Theorem 5.15: the walks of the cyclic scheme.

Definition 5.13 declares an edge between blocks `Q` and `P` when *some* cone
favored in `Q` contains `P` based at `Q`. That is too weak for Step 2, which
picks one representative per block and runs it along the whole block walk: a
block sitting between two edges would have to be a majority point for both
witnessing cones at once, and different edges may be witnessed by different
favored cones.

The paper's own phrasing repairs this — "choose for every block a favored cone" —
so we work with the graph relative to such a choice. Proposition 5.14 produces
exactly this, since its proof fixes a favored cone per block before doing
anything else.

/-! ## The alternating walk

The scheme's walk visits `ρ B α` and `ρ B β` alternately along the block walk;
recursively, one steps to the next block and swaps the two indices, which
produces exactly the paper's `q^k_i` at odd `k` and `q^k_{i+j}` at even `k`. -/

/-- **The lift of a block walk to `G`.** Given a representative `ρ B i` in the
majority set of each block, a walk in the choice graph lifts to a walk in `G` of
the same length, alternating between the two given indices.

Every edge of the lift joins a representative of index `α` to one of index `β`.
That is what bounds an interior edge's multiplicity in Step 6: the edge reveals
both indices, and hence — once `α` and `β` are chosen as `f(y) + g(x)` and
`g(x)` — both hashes. -/

/-! ## Blocks at distinct centres are distinct

Needed because `choiceAdj` carries `Q ≠ P`: the walk must not step from a block to
itself. Sparse population gives `h > √d ℓ`, so the cubes at distinct centres of
the index lattice are disjoint, and `ℓ ≥ 1` makes them nonempty. -/
