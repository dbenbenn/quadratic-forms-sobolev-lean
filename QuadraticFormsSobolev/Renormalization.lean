/-! ## The paper's constant

The proof of Lemma 5.9 passes through the intermediate estimate

> if `y ∈ Ṽ[x]` and `|x − y| ≥ ℓ√d/(2 sin ϑ)`, then `B_{ℓ√d/2}(y) ⊆ V̄[x]`,

and concludes with `δ = 3√d/(2 sin ϑ)`. By `coneGap_eq_norm_mul_sin` the distance
from `y` to the boundary of `V̄[x]` is exactly `‖y − x‖ sin(ϑ − ∠(v, y−x))`, and
`y ∈ Ṽ[x]` only bounds `∠(v, y−x)` by `ϑ/2`. So at the threshold distance the
available gap can be as small as `ℓ√d sin(ϑ/2)/(2 sin ϑ)`, and the lemma below
says this is *always* less than the `ℓ√d/2` the estimate needs. -/

/-- The threshold distance used in the paper's proof of Lemma 5.9 is too small,
for every admissible apex angle: the gap it guarantees falls strictly short of
what the estimate requires. -/

therefore carries an explicit `Q ≠ P`. On nonempty blocks this changes nothing,

/-- **Proposition 5.14** of Bux–Kassmann–Schulze. For every radius `r` there is
`R ≥ r`, depending only on `r`, `ϑ` and `d`, such that in a `ϑ`-sparsely
populated town of scale `(h, ℓ)` any two blocks whose indices lie within `r` of a
point `z` of the index lattice are connected in the favored graph by a path
through blocks whose indices stay within `R` of `z`.

The proof is the paper's: the town is identified with `ℤ^d` by `x ↦ Q_ℓ(hx)`, the
configuration `x ↦` (the cone of apex angle `ϑ/2` with the axis of a cone favored
in `Q_ℓ(hx)`) is `ϑ/2`-bounded, Lemma 5.9 turns each of its edges into an edge of
the favored graph — this is exactly where sparse population is used, since it
makes `δℓ < h ≤ ‖hx − hy‖` for distinct `x, y` — and Corollary 5.8 supplies the
connectivity. -/
